## Implementation Details

1. **New Files:**
   - `/frontend/src/components/charts/DexcomStyleChart.tsx`
   - `/frontend/src/components/ai/EnhancedRecommendationCard.tsx`
   - `/frontend/src/screens/EnhancedDashboardScreen.tsx`
   - `/frontend/src/screens/EnhancedTrendsScreen.tsx`
   - `/frontend/src/styles/screens/EnhancedTrendsScreen.ts`

2. **Modified Files:**
   - `/ai/insights_engine.py` - Enhanced recommendation generation
   - Other backend files to support the new features

## Next Steps

To fully implement these changes in the application, follow these steps:

1. **Update Navigation to Use Enhanced Screens**
   - In your navigation setup (e.g., `Navigation.tsx`):
     ```tsx
     // Use the new enhanced screens for a modern experience
     <Stack.Screen name="Dashboard" component={EnhancedDashboardScreen} />
     <Stack.Screen name="Trends" component={EnhancedTrendsScreen} />
     ```

2. **Test the UI with Different Data Scenarios**
   - Try the app with:
     - Sparse data
     - Frequent readings
     - Missing readings
     - Extreme glucose values

3. **Validate Recommendations**
   - Review the enhanced AI recommendations with diabetes professionals for clinical accuracy and usefulness.

4. **Optimize Performance**
   - Consider implementing server-side caching for recommendations to improve speed and scalability.
