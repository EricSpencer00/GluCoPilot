## Important Disclaimer

This software is designed for personal health management and educational purposes only. 
It is NOT intended for medical diagnosis, treatment, or to replace professional medical advice.

### Health Data Disclaimer

- Always consult with qualified healthcare professionals for medical decisions
- This application provides insights based on patterns in your data, not medical advice
- Do not make medication or treatment changes based solely on app recommendations
- In case of medical emergencies, contact emergency services immediately
- Verify all glucose readings with approved medical devices when making treatment decisions

### Data Privacy

- All health data is stored locally on your device
- No health information is transmitted to external servers without explicit consent
- Users are responsible for maintaining the security of their device and data
- Regular backups are recommended to prevent data loss

### Regulatory Compliance

This software has not been evaluated by the FDA or other regulatory bodies for medical use.
It is provided as a personal health management tool under the MIT License terms above.

### AI Models & Data Processing

- GluCoPilot may use open-source AI models to generate insights and recommendations. Specifically, Hugging Face's open-source models (e.g., OSS 20B and OSS 120B) are used when AI-generated insights are produced.
- All health data used with these AI models is anonymized before it is sent for transient processing. No personal identifiers are included in the data sent to the models.
- The app's data transformations for AI are stateless and transient: input data is processed for the immediate request and is not persisted by the AI processing pipeline in any database owned by the developer.
- If you enable any optional cloud features or cloud backups, those services are described separately and require explicit consent.

### Accuracy and Medical Disclaimer

- AI-generated insights are probabilistic and may be inaccurate or incomplete. Do not make clinical or medication decisions based solely on AI output.
- This software is intended to provide general guidance to support diabetes self-management and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
- Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional (endocrinologist, diabetes educator, or primary care physician) for medical decisions.

### Data Storage & Ownership

- Health data collected and used by the app is stored locally on the user's device (HealthKit or app-managed encrypted storage) unless the user explicitly enables cloud sync or exports data.
- The developer does not store or own users' raw health data in an external database by default. Any exception to this will be clearly disclosed and require explicit user consent.
