description: |
  Project contains a reference-only `new-frontend` folder. This folder is not used by the main build
  and should not be modified or compiled. Use the main mobile frontends under `GluCoPilot/` or
  `frontend/` instead.

reference_only:
  - path: new-frontend/**
  - reason: "Reference-only. Do not modify or run."

editor_integration_suggestions:
  - vscode: |
      Add the following to `.vscode/settings.json` to hide/exclude the folder from Explorer and Search:
      {
        "files.exclude": { "new-frontend/": true },
        "search.exclude": { "new-frontend/": true }
      }
